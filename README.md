This first project, init, will give you the opportunity to discover system and network
basic commands, many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few ideas of
scripts that can be useful for SysAdmins on a daily basis.

"Network" was done on school MAC's, "System" and "Scripting" on virtual machine, I used VirtualBox and debian system without interface, only command line.
